 		1-->	in ArrayList,vector and LinkedList by default it is not naturalsorting because underlying datastructure is resizable Array
 			so that why we are using Collection.sort() here to sort the elements
 			
 		2-->	TreeSet by default it is naturalsorting because underlyingdatasture is binarysearch it follow the in order teqnique
 			so we are not use any Collectios.sort() here
 			
 		3-->	where as other dadastructures in the collection we are going to use the comparator interface and compare method to sort the elements
 		
 		4-->    for HashSet and LinkedHashSet either natural or custome sortings are not done to do sorting we need to convert into ArrayList
 				 then using comparable-->comparTo-->Collections.sort() we can sort it
