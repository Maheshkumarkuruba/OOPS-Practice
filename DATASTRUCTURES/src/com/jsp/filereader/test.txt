leaf node or external node
a nodes which doesnot consist of any child nodes is called as leaf node  or external node
sibings
the children of the same parent node is called siblings
subtree
any node of the tree along with the childe node is called subtree
no of edges
no of edges is given by no of node-1 
depth of the node
depth of the node is consider as length of the path from root node to current node 
height of the node
it is given by the longest path from current node to leaf node
height of the tree
the longest path from root node to leaf node
